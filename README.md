## MiniSumo Robot ‚Äì ATmega328P (KoNaR Workshop Project)

This project is a MiniSumo robot developed during a workshop organized by the KoNaR student scientific association. It is based on the ATmega328P microcontroller and represents my first hands-on experience with designing, assembling, and programming a robot from scratch.

## Overview

The goal of the project was to create an autonomous MiniSumo robot that could:
- Detect and engage with an opponent using distance sensors
- Stay within the ring using line sensors
- Control DC motors for movement via an H-bridge

## Working Features

Despite the project being incomplete, several features were successfully implemented:
- ‚úÖ **DC motor control** using an H-bridge
- ‚úÖ **Distance measurement** from four VL53L0X sensors (basic functionality working)

## Issues and Challenges

Several hardware issues prevented full functionality:
- ‚ùå Incorrect electrical connections
- ‚ùå Improper wiring of XSHUT pins for the VL53L0X distance sensors
- ‚ùå Faulty connections for line sensors

Due to these problems, the robot was not fully operational, and the project was paused before final testing and competition.

## Future Plans

Although the current version of the robot is unfinished, I may return to this project in the future to redesign the PCB, correct the hardware issues, and complete the software stack.
